        <h2>Description</h2>
            i havent had sushi in so long im drooling too hard to focus.
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bamboo rolling mat</li>
                <li>Plastic wrap</li>
                <li>Sharp knife</li>
                <li>Sushi rice</li>
                <li>thin chopped veggies</li>
                <li>Smoked salmon/shrimp</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Process:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get one for as little as $7 on Amazon) on a cutting board so the bamboo strips are running horizontally to you. Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat. Then place a sheet (or a half sheet) of nori on the plastic wrap.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori. (See below for more about making perfect sushi rice.)</li>
                <li>Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori. Don't overpack it. If you're making a roll with the rice on the outside, simply turn the nori over, placing it rice-side down on the rolling mat. Then add your ingredients to the top of the nori.</li>
                <li>Gently lift the bottom of the mat up and over the sushi. Press and shape the ingredients into a tube. Roll with pressure so you get a firm roll.</li>
                <li>Roll until just an inch of nori shows at the top. Seal the edge of the nori with a little cold water. Firm it up by squeezing the mat around the roll until it feels uniformly snug. Be careful not to squeeze so hard that the ingredients are smashed or come oozing out the sides. It's a fine line; with practice you'll get the feel of it.</li>
                <li>Slice the sushi roll in half with a sharp knife on a cutting board. Then cut each half into thirds -- so you have 6 pieces of sushi. To get a nice clean cut, wet the knife with water each time you make a slice.</li>
                <li>Line the slices of sushi up on platters or sushi plates. Enjoy with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger, and a little chopped daikon if you like.</li>
